# Deploy a Free Cloudera training environment over Google Cloud Engine
Ideal guide for whom who wants to get familiar with Cloudera Hadoop distribution and would like to setup a cluster from scratch using the Google Cloude free subscription. 
This is a study guide I made for the Cloudera Certified Administrator (CCA) that I am preparing. This is for test exam code CCA-131 (https://www.cloudera.com/more/training/certification/cca-admin.html). 
I did take the class offered from Cloudera and I used the O'Reilly books "Hadoop The Definitive Guide (4th edition)" to study. 
I also used the Cloudera support website documentation. The Apache Hadoop website is also a great site for even more documentation.
